Animanager Migration
====================

This is Animanager release 0.9.0.

The purpose of this release is to "receive" migrated databases from 0.8.1.  See
the 0.8.1 README for details.

This release is not feature complete or documented in any meaningful sense, but
enough features have been provided for basic life-support management; type `?`
after running `animanager anime`.
