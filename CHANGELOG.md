  "trashed" into a subdirectory, where the user can recover them or purge them
  at his leisure.
- Watch command behavior changed, now prompts the user to select a file for each
  episode if there are multiple files, instead of attempting to choose one
  automatically by version and deleting the rest.

  regular expressions are ignored.

### Fixed
